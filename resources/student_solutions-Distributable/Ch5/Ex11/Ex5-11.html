The relationship between <tt>Scanner</tt> and <tt>Reader</tt> is <i>not</i>
an example of the D<small>ECORATOR</small> pattern. If a <tt>Scanner</tt>
was a D<small>ECORATOR</small> for a <tt>Reader</tt>, then <tt>Scanner</tt>
would have to be a subclass of <tt>Reader</tt>. However, it is an
unrelated class.
