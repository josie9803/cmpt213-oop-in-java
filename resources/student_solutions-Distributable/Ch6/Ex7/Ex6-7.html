If it were possible for a subclass method to throw more exceptions than a
method that it overrides, then the exception 
checking mechanism could be defeated, as shown in this example:
<pre>
   T t = new S();  // S is a subclass of T
   t.m();          // Assume that m() in S throws more 
                   //  checked exceptions than m() in T throws.
</pre>
In this case, the compiler only considers the exceptions thrown by
method m() in class T.  
However, since t points to an object from class S, 
the call t.m() could cause a checked exception to be thrown that the
compiler would not be aware of.
