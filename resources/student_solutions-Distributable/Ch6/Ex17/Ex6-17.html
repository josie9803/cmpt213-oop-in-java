This is an example of the TEMPLATE METHOD pattern. The superclass <code>SelectableShape</code>
defines the <code>drawSelection(Graphics2D g2)</code> method that
calls <code>draw(Graphics2D g2)</code> and <code>getBounds()</code>
as primitive operations. Two subclasses:<code> CarShape</code> and <code>HouseShape</code>
supply the primitive operations as is most appropriate for them.
