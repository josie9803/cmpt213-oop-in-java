The keyword <code>super</code> can be used to access a member
that is declared in the superclass
(ie call a superclass method or access a superclass field) 
or to call a constructor defined in the superclass.
When <code>super</code> is used with parentheses (ie <code>super()</code>)
it is being used to invoke a constructor from the superclass.
