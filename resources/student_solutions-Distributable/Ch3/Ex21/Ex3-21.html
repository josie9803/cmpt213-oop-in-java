The class java.util.File is not consistent.  Suffixes are used
inconsistently as in, for example, getAbsoluteFile() and getAbsolutePath()
versus getParentFile() and getParent().  There is a method to set the
read only attribute of a file, but no method to make the file readable and
writeable.

<p>
The complexity of the explanations of methods listRoots() and 
createTempFile() demonstrates the lack of clarity of these methods.

<p>
The class lacks cohesion because it seems to be designed to support
several different goals.
The stated purpose is to be 
"an abstract representation of file and directory path names".
Another goal is to do various file status queries, and yet another is to create
temporary files and do directory operations.
On top of that are several methods for manipulating URL's and URI's.
