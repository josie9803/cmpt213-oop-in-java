The interface Drawable separates the code for drawing from the rest of the 
code for implementing the Icon interface.  This allows Drawable objects to
be used for purposes other than as Icons, and it allows for easier
implementation of Icons since only the drawable object need be passed in
when a DrawableIcon is created.
