An <code>ActionListener</code> is not a command object as seen in the
Command pattern.  It is not designed to allow manipulation of the state
of a concrete <code> ActionListener</code>, 
and in fact, the concrete <code> ActionListener </code>
may very well not have a state.  The <code>ActionListener</code>
is also not designed for creating collections of commands.
